# Google Drive Direct Download
A Python Program to convert Google Drive Link into Direct Download Link

# How it works?
## Typical Shared Link Format:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/YourUniqueFileCode/view?usp=sharing
## Convert the Link Format as below to get Direct Download Link Format
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YourUniqueFileCode

# Road Map
- [x] Basic Convertion
- ~~[ ] Ask User For Loop~~ (Seems Like Not Useful)
- [ ] Auto Save Link History into a new file
- [x] Catch for invalid link with try and except block
- [ ] GUI ?
